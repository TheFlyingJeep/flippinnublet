Source code for my main website where most of my projects can be accessed
Source code for individual projects on my website will be accessible on my github
Website here: flippinnublet.com

Most of my website is built with php
In development projects will not appear on the website even if public viewing is intentional
Any code written by someone else will include a citation and a link to their github and an outline of their work
